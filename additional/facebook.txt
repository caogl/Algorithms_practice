Celebrity problem:
You have a room with n people. A celebrity walks in. Everyone knows the celebrity, the celebrity knows no one. Non-celebrities may/may not know anyone in the room. Give an algorithm to find the celebrity. Discuss the complexity.

The solution is O(n) in time complexity.

Make all of them stand in a row.
Lets say the people are a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,.......n

Compare a and b.
if a knows b => a is certainly not the celebrity. Probable celebrity = b
if a doesnt know b => b is certainly not the celebrity. Probable celebrity = a

In either case compare the probable celebrity to the next person in line ie 'c' and repeat the process. Each comparison should eliminate 1 person and have another as the probable celebrity. At the end, the probable celebrity who survives is the certain celebrity.

If a and b dont know each other, they both will eventually get eliminated

Complexity = O(n)
