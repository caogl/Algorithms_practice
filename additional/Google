Data-structure and algorithm used in Load Balancer?
Explaining algorithm write code for it

We can use something like a min-heap. Where the node value is the number of connections handled by the server.
Each server can maintain a list of clients it is serving. 
In addition to this we can have a HashMap to store the <client,server> pair to retrieve the server.

写一个PeekIterator，包装一个普通的Iterator，要实现peek()方法，返回当前iterator指向的元素，但是不能移动它。
除此之外也要实现has_next()和next()方法。
--> This is in fact a Java question, because has_next() and next() are Java-specific iterator operation.
--> 策略：告诉面试官做过了， 要换！

(3) http://www.fgdsb.com/2015/01/18/merge-BST/
You are given two balanced binary search trees. Write a function that merges the two given balanced BSTs into a 
balanced binary search tree. Your merge function should take O(M+N) time and O(1) space.

G家onsite题，算是很多小问题的综合题。因为不允许用extra space，可以先把两个输入BST给转换成链表，然后merge两个链表，
再把merge完的链表重新转化成BST。
